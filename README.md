# My SQL Practice Repository

A personal collection of SQL queries and solutions I'm working on as a student. This repository tracks my learning progress from basic to advanced concepts.

---

## Topics Covered

* **Basic Queries:** `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`
* **Aggregate Functions:** `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
* **Joins:** `INNER`, `LEFT`, `OUTER`
* **Subqueries**
* **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**
* **Window Functions:** `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `LEAD()`, `LAG()`
* **Data Manipulation:** `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`

## How to Use

The files are organized by topic. Each file contains practice problems and my solutions. You can use the `schema.sql` file to set up the tables in your own local database environment (like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite) to run the queries yourself.
